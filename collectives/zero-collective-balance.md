# Zero Collective Balance

Before [changing hosts](add-or-change-fiscal-host.md#changing-fiscal-host) or [closing a Collective](closing-a-collective.md), the balance must be at zero.

You can move money out of your Collective in several ways:

* [submit expenses](../expenses/submitting-expenses.md) to withdraw funds
* [donating to another Collective](../backers-and-sponsors/collective-to-collective-donations.md) in the same fiscal host
* giving the remaining balance to your host by clicking the 'Empty Balance' button

## Leftover Balance

Due to the design of the Open Collective system, sometimes if you try to withdraw 100% of your balance, a small amount will be unintentionally left behind. This is usually caused by fees being hard to predict exactly.

If this happens, go to 'edit Collective &gt; 'advanced' and use the 'Empty Balance' button to transfer the remaining funds to your fiscal host.
