# Gift Cards

See our dedicated [Gift Cards](https://opencollective.com/gift-cards) page for an introduction to gift cards.

## Create gift cards

To create Gift Cards for your [Organization](organizations.md), go to **Edit Organization** and then **Gift Cards**. From there you'll also be able to see your pending and redeemed gift cards.

We currently offer three options for gift cards distribution.

### 1. By email - Fast & Easy, but no customization possible

You can give us a list of emails and we'll send the gift cards out, or you can generate gift card codes and send them out yourself.
